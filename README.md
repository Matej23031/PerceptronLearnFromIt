This code was done with the help of William Munsch and professor Schattn as a starter for ML/dev. Using optimized routines. With no predefined classification algorithms. (za moje rvatine koje ovo citaju, svaki improvement je dobro dosao, baziran je na Munschevom kodu, random shuffleri inputa su samo optimizacija Munsch je izdao mnogo citljiviji kod od mojeg spageti smeca, ovo nije ozbiljan repo nego samo nes sastrane sta ucim uz faks pa sam stavio.

# Iris Perceptron Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron, a type of artificial neural network model, used to classify instances of the Iris dataset into two classes: Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor. It's an example of binary classification with a linear classifier implemented in C++.

## Features
- **C++ Implementation**: Leverages C++ features like vectors, random devices, and more to implement the model.
- **Interactive Input**: Users can input features via the command line to classify new Iris flowers in real-time.
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Implements dynamic adjustments of weights based on the training data.

## Getting Started
To run the classifier on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make sure that the compiler supports C++17 or later for the best compatibility.

To provide instructions specific to the repository URL you've given, the steps will need to be tailored to the exact repository path provided. Here's a revised version of your installation instructions that incorporates the URL:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   Use the following command in your terminal to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Matej23031/PerceptronLearnFromIt.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the cloned directory:**
   Change into the directory of the cloned repository by running:
   ```bash
   cd PerceptronLearnFromIt
   ```


## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter values for the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. After inputting these, the program will classify the Iris flower based on the learned model.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Ensure to update tests as appropriate.
