Below is a sample README.md that you could use for your GitHub repository containing the Perceptron-based classifier for the Iris dataset:
This code was done with the help of William Munsch and professor Schattn as a starter for ML/dev. Using optimized routines. With no predefined classification algorithms.

# Iris Perceptron Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron, a type of artificial neural network model, used to classify instances of the Iris dataset into two classes: Iris Setosa and Iris Versicolor. It's an example of binary classification with a linear classifier implemented in C++.

## Features
- **C++ Implementation**: Leverages C++ features like vectors, random devices, and more to implement the model.
- **Interactive Input**: Users can input features via the command line to classify new Iris flowers in real-time.
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Implements dynamic adjustments of weights based on the training data.

## Getting Started
To run the classifier on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites  
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make sure that the compiler supports C++17 or later for the best compatibility.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-perceptron-classifier.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-perceptron-classifier
   ```
3. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o iris_classifier main.cpp Perceptron.cpp
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./iris_classifier
   ```

## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be prompted to enter values for the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. After inputting these, the program will classify the Iris flower based on the learned model.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Ensure to update tests as appropriate.

### Notes:
1. **File Structure**: I assumed you have at least two main files: `main.cpp` and `Perceptron.cpp`. If your structure differs, please adjust the README accordingly.
2. **Compiler Instructions**: Adjust the compiler instructions based on the actual requirements or if there are additional files.
3. **License**: The MIT License is suggested; you should add a LICENSE file to your repository if you agree, or specify another license if you prefer.

Feel free to customize the README further based on your specific needs or additional functionalities of your project.
